# Singapore-Resale-Flat-Prices-Predicting
This project is to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application that predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore. This predictive model will be based on historical data of resale flat transactions, and it aims to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.
I have done this project in VSCode and installed the necessary packages and created a new environment to work on this project.
